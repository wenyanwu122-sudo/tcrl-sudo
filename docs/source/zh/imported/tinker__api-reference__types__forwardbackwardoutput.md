# tinker.types.ForwardBackwardOutput

## *class* [**tinker.types.ForwardBackwardOutput**](https://github.com/thinking-machines-lab/tinker/blob/main/src/tinker/types/forward_backward_output.py\#L12)(**)[​](\#class-tinkertypesforwardbackwardoutput)

**Fields:**

- **loss_fn_output_type**
  
  – The class name of the loss function output records (e.g., 'TorchLossReturn', 'ArrayRecord').
- **loss_fn_outputs**
  
  – List of per-datum dicts mapping field names to
  
  `TensorData`
  
  .
- **metrics**
  
  – Training metrics as key-value pairs.

The following metrics are recorded only during MoE (Mixture of Experts) training.

- `e_frac_with_tokens:mean`: Fraction of experts that received at least one token, averaged across layers. A value of 1.0 means every expert got work; 0.5 means half were idle. Decreasing over time is concerning (routing collapse).
- `e_frac_oversubscribed:mean`: Fraction of experts receiving more tokens than perfect balance, averaged across layers. Increasing over time is concerning.
- `e_max_violation:mean`: How much the most overloaded expert exceeds perfect balance, as a fraction of perfect balance, averaged across layers. Computed as `(max_tokens - perfect_balance) / perfect_balance`. A value of 2.0 means the busiest expert got 3x the fair share. Increasing over time is concerning.
- `e_max_violation:max`: Same as `e_max_violation:mean` but takes the max across layers instead of the mean.
- `e_min_violation:mean`: How much the least loaded expert is below perfect balance, as a fraction of perfect balance, averaged across layers. Typically negative; decreasing (more negative) is concerning.
